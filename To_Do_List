1. comments as code:

		if (request->getError() != 0)
		{
	 		errorPage(request->getError());
	 		return ;
		}


2.
 check allwoed Methods

3.timeout , Bad request header....

4. if I have two servers with same port and differnt at everything else ??

5. check what directory listing on config file 

<< Just remember that, for chunked request, your server needs to unchunk
it, the CGI will expect EOF as end of the body. : SUBJECT>>

6. sigle() for CTRL + R, problem 

7. match the longest path of location : /user/home not /user .

8.  {"POST", "GET", "DELETE", "HEAD", ...}; there NOT IMPLEMENTED and BAD REQ

9. encoding SPACE <==> %20 

10. nabboune needs to check the ErrorFlag varible first (when the request is unvalid he dosn't set done serving)

11.we do need to check for the host in the request header since it may the same port ad host, but differet serverName 

12. match location with it's client
