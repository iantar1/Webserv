* Introduction: 

-> When writing programs that communicate across a computer network, one must first invent a

-> Also note that the client and server are typically user processes, while the
TCP and IP protocols are normally part of the protocol stack within the kernel.

    is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to load webpages using hypertext links.
    HTTP is an application layer protocol designed to transfer information between networked
        devices and runs on top of other layers of the `network protocol stack`.

* IPC (InterProcess Communication) : 


-> In Transport Layer, we mainly use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to
    implement HTTP server.
